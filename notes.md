Breaking down react





Page loads

Form w/ buttons

Reactify the Form (handle-changes)

pass APIs( users, cats, dogs etc)

Buttons work (handle SUbmit)

Get Data PrePopulated

get user works (get users, post users)

Connect data to 

connect data populated


React conceptually is "very stupid". Danny the lecturer explains: Our first project, JS and tiny HTML, along with JS objects.

PRoject 2: nvermind we arent using JS objects, lets put it into a DB and link to it. 
And instead of HTML are going to use Handle Brs


Project 3:is the same layout as PRoject 2, the bit difference is using handlebars in prject 2, ahile we switch it out from hNdlebarso . REACT feels more complex because it has b=more pieces, but hypothetically e could have switched out HNDBRS for Reat.

Functionality and Form:

Instances:
Model List w/ be a Functional 
while
Model SHow is a form. Is is important to be able to distinguish between coding styles. Functionality versus Form. Form is appearance while Functionality has more to do with how the App's components work. 


Copy, Pasting and modifying; 
These are great skills to have but they create


the haredst thing: WHere do I make my API calls. THe call itself should or could be placed it the top most parent 

some people "Get" there APIS on the top of every page instead of inside the parent component such as "Users"
